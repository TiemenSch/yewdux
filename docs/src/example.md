# Quickstart example

Below you'll find a simple counter example, demonstrating how to read and write to shared state.
Only one component is shown here for simplicity, however keep in mind every other component that
uses the same `Counter` store type will share its state!

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;
use yewdux::prelude::*;

#[derive(Debug, Default, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Store)]
struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

#[function_component]
fn App() -> Html {
    let (counter, dispatch) = use_store::<Counter>();
    let onclick = dispatch.reduce_mut_callback(|counter| counter.count += 1);

    html! {
        <>
        <p>{ counter.count }</p>
        <button {onclick}>{"+1"}</button>
        </>
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::Renderer::<App>::new().render();
}
```

## Additional examples

Complete working examples can be found in the
[examples](https://github.com/intendednull/yewdux/tree/master/examples) folder of github.

To run an example you'll need to install [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) (a rust wasm
bundler), then run the following command (replacing [example] with your desired example name):

    trunk serve examples/[example]/index.html --open
